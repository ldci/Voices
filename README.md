# Voices
Some tests to use voices **with macOS**. Code mainly uses macOS *say* command.

* A version for Red for macOS Mojave (32-bit).
* A version for Rebol 3 for macOS Sequoia (64-bit).

Both versions are (quite) similar, but macOS 15.0.1 (Sequoia) includes more voices than macOS 10.14.6 (Mojave). Of course, Red can not yet use 64-bit macOS version, and there is no GUI for Rebol 3.
